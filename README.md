# Smart Home IoT Simulation

A smart home simulation built using a Raspberry Pi 400 and a breadboard.  
The project models real-world home automation by integrating sensors, actuators, user preferences, and a web-based dashboard.

The system was developed in four incremental phases, focusing on hardware–software integration and automation logic.
